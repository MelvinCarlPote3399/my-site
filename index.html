        <p><em><strong>Computer Engineering Student</strong></em></p>
        <p>
          I am a computer engineering student from Toronto, Ontario, Canada, attending
          Humber College. I originally attended Ryerson University as a student of their
          civil engineering program, but dropped out, and decided to make the transition
          into a new program. I was first exposed to coding in high school, where I took
          a course that introduced me to Scratch and Java. In university, I was introduced
          to the C programming language as part of our general curriculum.
          I aspire to work at a tech company in the future, as a
          web developer, or as a software engineer.
